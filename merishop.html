<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 20, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Meri Shop</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>When you use our app, we collect the following information: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your email address (via Gmail account chooser).</li>
  <li>
      When <strong>you entered your password</strong> for account create purposes. This password is <strong>encrypted securely</strong> before storing in our backend.
    </li>
  <li><strong>Shop Information:</strong> Shop name,shop image(profile),posts, owner name, city, state, address,contact( phone number or email ), and shop status  (Open, Closed, or any custom status  text you choose).</li>
  <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Favorites stored locally on your device (using AsyncStorage), login tokens, and user reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Device Permissions</h2>
<p> Our app only requires Internet access permission to communicate with our servers and upload data securely.
        We do not request any permissions to access your device’s photos, media, or camera directly.
        When you choose to upload images, the app uses your device’s native photo picker, which allows you to select photos without granting the app direct access to your media or storage. This ensures your privacy and control over your files.
        We only access the photos or files that you explicitly select and do not access or store any other data from your device.
</p>

<h2>3. Profile View Count</h2>
<p>The app tracks how many times a user's profile is viewed. This view count is stored securely in our database and is only visible to the respective user. We do not share this data with any third parties.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Backend</h2>
<p>All shop-related data including shop name,shop image(profile),posts, owner name, city, state, address,contact(phone number or email), view count and status or note is <strong>stored securely on our backend servers hosted on AWS</strong> and saved in a MongoDB database.</p>
<p>This information is <strong>publicly visible to all users of the app</strong> when browsing or searching shops.</p>
<p>The <strong>status field is flexible</strong>, allowing shop owners to enter any text describing their shop’s current state.</p>
<p>Uploaded images are securely stored on our cloud storage (such as AWS S3 and MongoDB) and are not shared with any third parties.</p>

<h2>5. Account Sign-In and Permissions</h2>
<p>When you sign up using your Gmail account, the app opens the Google Account Chooser modal <strong>directly without requesting any additional device permissions</strong> such as location or contacts.</p>
<p>This ensures a quick, secure, and privacy-friendly sign-up process.</p>
<p>We only access your <strong>email address</strong> for authentication purposes.</p>

  <h2>6.User-Generated Content (UGC)</h2>
