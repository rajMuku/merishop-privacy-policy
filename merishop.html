<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Your Shop App</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>When you use our app, we collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your  email  (via Gmail account chooser).</li>
  <li><strong>Shop Information:</strong> Shop name, owner name, city, state, address, and shop status (Open, Closed, or any custom status text you choose).</li>
  <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Favorites stored locally on your device (using AsyncStorage), login tokens, and user reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Data Storage and Backend</h2>
<p>All shop-related data including shop name, owner name, city, state, address, and status is <strong>stored securely on our backend servers hosted on AWS</strong> and saved in a MongoDB database.</p>
<p>This information is <strong>publicly visible to all users of the app</strong> when browsing or searching shops.</p>
<p>The <strong>status field is flexible</strong>, allowing shop owners to enter any text describing their shop’s current state.</p>

<h2>3. Google Account Sign-In and Permissions</h2>
<p>When you sign up using your Gmail account, the app opens the Google Account Chooser modal <strong>directly without requesting any additional device permissions</strong> such as location or contacts.</p>
<p>This ensures a quick, secure, and privacy-friendly sign-up process.</p>
<p>We only access your <strong>email address </strong> for authentication purposes.</p>

<h2>4. Favorites and Local Storage</h2>
<p>You can save your favorite shops locally on your device using <strong>AsyncStorage</strong>.</p>
<p>Favorites data is stored only on your device and is <strong>deleted automatically when you log out</strong>.</p>
<p>Your authentication token is also removed securely on logout to protect your privacy.</p>

<h2>5. Data Editing and Deletion</h2>
<p>You can <strong>edit your personal and shop information</strong> anytime within the app.</p>
<p>To <strong>delete your Gmail account data from our servers</strong>, a formal request must be sent via your registered Gmail address to ensure secure verification.</p>
<p>We comply with all applicable laws regarding data privacy and deletion.</p>

<h2>6. User Reporting and Policy Enforcement</h2>
<p>Users can <strong>report any shop or user for inappropriate content or policy violations</strong> directly via the app.</p>
<p>All reports are sent securely to our team via email.</p>
<p>Our dedicated moderation team reviews all reports and takes necessary action including warnings, suspension, or removal of violating content.</p>
<p>This ensures a safe and trustworthy environment for all users.</p>

<h2>7. Logout and Data Removal</h2>
<p>Logging out removes all local favorite shops and your login authentication token from your device.</p>
<p>This prevents unauthorized access and keeps your data safe.</p>

<h2>8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>Our app may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your user experience.</p>
<p>Cookies help remember your preferences and app settings.</p>
<p>You can disable cookies on your device, but some app features may not work properly.</p>

<h2>9. Compliance with Laws and Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We follow all relevant laws and regulations including Indian data protection laws.</p>
<p>Our app is not intended for children under 18 years old.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect data from children under 18.</p>

<h2>10. Sharing Your Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information.</p>
<p>Information is shared only with trusted service providers who help us operate the app and maintain servers, under strict confidentiality.</p>

<h2>11. Security</h2>
<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally.</p>
